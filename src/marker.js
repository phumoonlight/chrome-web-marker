// The on-page half of Web Marker: links pointing at a page you have marked
// unread glow blue, and links to pages you have already read can be faded, so
// what stands out on a page is what you haven't got to yet. Nothing is added to
// the page — no dot, no badge, only a class on links already there — and the
// script is read-only besides: it can never change a status, so a mistimed click
// on a busy page can't quietly rewrite your marks. Marking is the popup's job.
// The marker is **per site** and off until this site's toggle in the popup is
// on — while off this script only watches that site's flag and touches nothing.
//
// Everything goes through the service worker: this script sends URLs and gets
// back state, so `urlKey()` in common.js stays the only definition of "the same
// page" — and the same for which site this is, which decides the storage key
// below. Content scripts can't import ES modules, so the appearance key is
// mirrored literally from common.js.
